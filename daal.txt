Daal
2 cup dal 
Â½ teaspoon turmeric
1 teaspoon salt
10 cup water


PREPARATION
1. Put dal, turmeric and salt in a large soup pot, add 7 cups water and bring to a gentle boil, stirring.
2. Turn heat very low and cover pot with lid slightly ajar. Check pot and stir frequently, as the dal has a tendency to boil over in the beginning. Skim off and discard any foam that rises. Cook for about 45 minutes, until quite soft. 
3. Taste and adjust salt.
