Salmon Rolls
2 pounds center-cut salmon fillet (about 1 3/4 lbs with skin and any fatty black surface flesh removed)
6 sheets nori (each about 8 in sq)
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon sugar

Cut the trimmed salmon fillet into 3 lengthwise strips. since the strip near the belly is thinner, fold it on itself so that each strip is about 1.5in thick, and 7-8in long.

rinse the nori sheets briefly under cool running water, wetting them on both sides. arrange them flat in one layer ont he table, and place a slamon strip in the center of each 3 sheets to make 3 rolls. Bring the sides fo the nori sheets up to encluse the salmon strips, sealing by pressing the edges together where they meet, then wrap each slamon roll in another nori sheet to make a thicker, stronger covering.

combine the salt, pepper, and sugar in a small bowl. line a cookie sheet with plastic wrap and sprinkle half the salt mixture on top. on a cutting board, cut each slamon roll crossiwse into 1/2in thick slickes. (36ish total, 12 from each). Arrange the slices, cut sides down, on the cookie sheet. sprinkle the remaning salt mixture on top of the slices, cover them with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hr before serving.
