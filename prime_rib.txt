1.
The day before, remove and clean the prime rib. Create a dry rub using:

Brown Sugar
Salt
Ground Black Pepper
Ancho Pepper
Smoked pimiento pepper
Ground Star Anise
Ginger powder
Garlic powder
Cumin Powder

2.
Place seasoned rib in roasting pan with fat cap up, tent with foil, and let sit overnight.

3.
Preheat oven to lowest possible temperature setting, 150°F or greater (some ovens can't hold a temperature below 200°F) Place roast, with fat cap up, on v-rack set in large roasting pan. Place in oven and cook until center of roast registers 120°F on an instant-read thermometer for medium-rare, or 135°F for medium. In a 150°F oven, this will take around 5 1/2 to 6 1/2 hours. In a 200°F oven, this will take 3 1/2 to 4 hours.

4.
Remove roast from oven. Place in a warm spot in the kitchen and allow to rest for at least 30 minutes, and up to an hour and a half. Meanwhile, preheat oven to highest possible temperature setting (500°F to 550°F).

5.
When the pan cools slightly, remove roast and scrape out the bottom. This is mostly melted sugar, and will burn in the oven at the higher temperature. Toss, or set aside to use as drizzle on served meat. 

6.
10 minutes before guests are ready to be served, remove foil, and place roast back in hot oven and cook until well-browned and crisp on the exterior, 6-10 minutes. Remove from oven, carve, and serve immediately.
