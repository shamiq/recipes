Ingredients for the Toasted S’more Shake

7 large marshmallows
3 scoops vanilla ice cream
1/2 cup fresh milk
5 slices graham crackers

Toast marshmallows inside the toaster oven until they’re charred on the outside and set aside to cool.

Place all other ingredients in the blender and mix everything together.
Slowly add in the marshmallows one at a time as they often have a tendency to get stuck on the blades.

Serve with whipped cream and grated dark chocolate.
